Dear User,

This is my Y2 Computing Project - Thermodynamics Snookered!

My code is very structured and meant to be user-friendly.
Hence, just open the "Thermodynamics Snookered - main.py", which is where the whole output is controlled from.
Documents are very well documented with docstrings and are "built" in a layered manner
i.e most files are just background code, while the "Thermodynamics Snookered- main.py" is the only thing
that the user actually needs to open.

So go into the "Thermodynamics Snookered- main.py"  and my comments shall guide you from there on.

You'll see, check it out!
Have fun :)
